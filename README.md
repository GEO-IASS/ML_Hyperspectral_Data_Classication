# ML_Hyperspectral_Data_Classication

1 Background and Motivation

Recently, hyperspectral remote sensing has gained attention in the remote sensing application
community. Hyperspectral imaging generates hundreds of images corresponding to different wavelength
channels for the same area on the surface of the earth. A hyperspectral image is a 3-D cube
of data with the width and length of the array corresponding to the spatial dimensions and the
continuous spectrum of each point as the third dimension, which enables discrimination of materials
based on their spectral characteristics. One of the most important applications of hyperspectral
data is image classification, where pixels are labeled to one of the classes based on their spectral
characteristics.

2. Results and Conclusion
total of 1200 examples are used for model training. For each of the three models, hyper
parameters were chosen based on the result of 5-fold cross validation. The result of the hyper
parameter selection is shown in Table 1.
